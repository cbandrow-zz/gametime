# Game Time BREAKOUT

## Summary

For our project of Gametime, we created a Breakout clone. But more specificly, we created Breakout in SPACE. Break bricks and beat the high score as you take on multiple levels and rounds of Breakout!

## Controls

Use your mouse or the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right. Launch the ball by pressing space bar or enter. When playing, you can redirect the ball by aiming and having the ball hit the sides of the paddle. Hitting the paddle left moves the ball left. Hitting the paddle right moves the ball right. 

The ball speed increases the better you do, so watch out and play smart!
